## RDK : Robot(ics) development kit
### Preamble:   
Write software that works and is reusable. Gradually move towards high-quality robotics software with comprehensive documentation and practical use cases.
---
###Points to keep in mind:
- Modular Design makes sense if it is documented well with example use cases to promote reusable 
- Best Practices: Adopt industry-standard software development practices to ensure:
  - Code efficiency
  - Maintainability
  - Scalability
- Agile Methodology: Implement agile practices to promote:
  - Iterative development
  - Continuous feedback
- Rapid adaptation to changes
- Simplify implementation
- Facilitate innovation in robotics
---
### Impact:   
Deliver valuable software solutions that support the actualization of robotic application that work in the wild!
